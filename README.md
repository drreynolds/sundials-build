# SUNDIALS-Build

## CMake configuration files for building SUNDIALS

This repository is designed to store configuration scripts for building SUNDIALS using the GNU compiler suite.  The primary motivation for this repository is so that I can easily transfer build options between my own computers, but since they could be useful to others I've made the repository public.
